#Customizing

You could have changed the "Powered by Example" to your project's name during the standard setup, if you haven't done this yet, please do so now. 

Next, 

You can change the following properties:

`Opacity` 

It is **NOT** reccomended to remove the other parts of the CSS unless you want the link underlined, then change the `Text-Decoration` to `Underlined`

More customizing options will be available in the future!
